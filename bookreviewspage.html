        <p>Welcome to my book reviews page! Now, this won't have all the books I've read because lord knows I read too damn many. I am 
          mainly planning on reviewing my favorites and least favorites. Books that stood out to me. And so, you're going to see a lot of 5 
          star and 1 star reviews. The 3 star books are just okay and I don't feel thinking about them for longer than I have to. Anyways, 
          please enjoy!

            <p>This book will always be one of my favorites. I've re-read it about a million times and when the movie came out, I watched 
              it like 5 times in a row. I love how the characters are written. I love the plot. I love everything! Alex? So funny and smart. 
              Henry? Timid and so darn cutie. This is such a feel good book and is worth the read. This is a short review but only because 
              there are not enough words to describe how cute and sweet and loving and awesome this book is. Go read it right now! The book 
              is better than the movie, though I thought the movie was cute too.

            <p> Oh here we go. This one's a doozy. My first bad review on here. So this review is from about a year ago I think? I typed it up 
              on my computer to vent and now I am sharing it with you. I was on a romance kick at this time, for context. (Still am tbh. Who doesn't love 
              a good romance?) Please excuse the lowercase everything and bad grammar. This was very much a rant. And very much dramatic. But 
              I digress.
              <br><br>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br>
              ok so i've been on a romance kick lately. 
              it's hard for me to read a book in general if it doesn't have some sort of romance in it. so i'm no longer repressing myself 
              and have just gone straight to the romance genre. i really do love those fairytale, happily ever after romances. and i like 
              historical romances, but it's sometimes hit or miss. this book, for example, was a miss for 
              me. i don't know why it got pretty good reviews on kindle, though i didn't really read the reviews. with historical romances, 
              in my opinion as a raging liberal, authors walk a fine line. like ok women don't have rights, but how is this love interest 
              going to respond to that. anyways this book, the Lady of Mystery i think it's called, i thought was going to be great. at 
              first, i loved Phoebe. she was amazing. wanted to change the world, fight for women's rights, refused to fall into the 
              restraints society attempted to put on her and was her own independent woman. now Jeffery i hated, naturally. as a man, 
              he obviously didn't believe in Phoebe's ideals. well not obviously, because everyone should believe in equality, but whatever. 
              i was willing to accept his stupidness and ignorance and rudeness and cockiness and all that for a brief moment, because i 
              thought he would change. i figured the author of this book cared about women's rights based on how they wrote Phoebe and would 
              never allow such a man to be a love interest for her. well long story short, i was disappointed. i made it through half way 
              without Jeffery even changing his ignorant ideals in even the slightest. the romance was ok at times, but never will i ever 
              in a million years EVER be ok with even attraction between such a horrible person. and maybe some would argue that he was a 
              gentleman most of the time, but to that i would say i give absolutely zero shits how he acts on the outside if inside he 
              believes women should have less rights than men simply because of their gender. i have decided not to read any more historical 
              romances for the time being because of this book. like what the fuck. and at the end, Phoebe was actually willing to step back 
              from her activist work for a man who didn't believe in the rights of women. AND even at the very end after the supposed 
              "make-up" after the inevitable conflict, Jeffery STILL disagreed with some of the things in Phoebe's paper outlining FUNDAMENTAL 
              HUMAN RIGHTS. fuck this book honestly. i skimmed through the second half. couldn't even bring myself to read the sexy scenes 
              because i was honestly pretty disgusted. so now that i'm done with these historical romances, i guess i'll read some modern 
              romances. sigh. i liked the historical setting. it seemed more romantic, more simple, more happily ever after. well fuck that. 
              i'm too much of a feminist for this shit.

            <h4>Eliot Schrefer</h4>
            <p>I read this book probably 4 years ago now, and it remains one of the best books I've ever read. Since it's been so long, this 
              review isn't going to be too in depth, but to anyone who sees this, this book is everything and you should go read it. I literally 
              used this book, this YA gay romance book, in essays when applying to colleges. This book shook me to my core. It is so devastating that 
              I will probably never reread it, seeing as I am such a sensitive soul. Maybe when I'm not a depressed 20 year old. Do not be fooled by my tenderness, 
              this book does have a happy ending and it's amazing.
              <br><br>
              The romance of this book was, in short, heartwrenching. We follow the story of two boys who keep finding and loving each other in spite 
              of the many hardships they face. God, I love this book. Aside from romance, this book analyzes many more in-depth questions of the 
              universe. Okay, maybe I'm being dramatic, but whatever. Here is an excerpt from the essay I was talking about. Don't judge me. I'm not 
              the best writer, okay. Chill out. All you need to know for context is that the essay is about how I like space.
              <br><br>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br>
              "One of my favorite young adult books containing space travel is Eliot Schrefer’s The Darkness Outside Us which follows the 
              journey of two boys as they venture through space to find a new, habitable planet after theirs is destroyed. The twist is that 
              the boys journeying are a couple of the many clones of themselves hidden on the spaceship. Every hundred years or so, when the 
              ship is in need of repairs, a new pair of clones is awoken, without recollection of any of the past clones’ lives or of even 
              getting on the ship to begin with, and then killed once the repairs are complete. The goal is that this process will continue 
              until the ship reaches its destination and the last pair of clones starts cultivating a new race of humans. This book is a 
              beautiful and tragic rendering of the loneliness of space and the potential of close proximity as a cause for both strong 
              relationships and volatile hostility. 
              <br>
              While The Darkness Outside Us may be a fictional book, it effectively conveys the concept of eternal space through the 
              characters’ loneliness and isolation, and it poses the questions of what happens after Earth can no longer support human life. 
              The technology and advanced ideas in the novel have merit, if such things were possible in real life, which they very well could 
              be in billions of years when the earth is eventually engulfed by the sun. The book touches upon the notion that (1) no human can 
              live long enough to brave space travel and land on a faraway planet and (2) no spacecraft can sustain life for the entire 
              duration of the trip. "

            <h4>By Kate Dylan</h4>
            <p>I thought this book was amazing. If you are (like I was) looking for a distopian fantasy with a badass female lead and an enemies 
              to lovers style romance that doesn't overwhelm the plot, this book is perfect for you. I thought the story was great. I thought the 
              characters were great. I laughed. I cried. Though the book really isn't sad, I'm just an empath. And I'm not joking. I cry at the 
              most not sad books. I cry if someone is being mean to the main character. I cry when the main character feels lost and alone. I cry 
              at literally any minor inconvenience the characters face. You will notice that will be a common theme in all my reviews. Anyways, 
              I thought this book was so fun and awesome. 
              <br><br>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br>
              The ending was less than satisfying in my opinion. It felt like there were just so many plotlines that didn't get their ending, but 
              I guess that's kind of the point? Like things don't just resolve themselves immediately. It also gives the reader the ability to 
              use their imagination to how things played out. As a romantic, I wish Sil and Ryder had an epilogue where they were all happy and 
              kissing, but whatever. I can use my imagination 
              <br><br>
              Another plotline I would've loved to see through is everything with Sil's family. We didn't get to see her reunite with her parents 
              after she was free of her CIP. I'd have liked her to go to them and have a great reunion where she said she was okay and would be 
              living for many years to come. What can I say, I just love happy endings. Not that we didn't get one... But still!
