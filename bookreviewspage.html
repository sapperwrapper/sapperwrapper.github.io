            <h3>The Darkness Outside Us: <img src="5stars.jpg" width="100px"></h3>
            <h4>Eliot Schrefer</h4>
            <p>I read this book probably 4 years ago now, and it remains one of the best books I've ever read. Since it's been so long, this 
              review isn't going to be too in depth, but to anyone who sees this, this book is everything and you should go read it. I literally 
              used this book, this YA gay romance book, in essays when applying to colleges. This book shook me to my core. It is so devastating that 
              I will probably never reread it, seeing as I am such a sensitive soul. Maybe when I'm not a depressed 20 year old. Do not be fooled by my tenderness, 
              this book does have a happy ending and it's amazing.
              <br><br>
              The romance of this book was, in short, heartwrenching. We follow the story of two boys who keep finding and loving each other in spite 
              of the many hardships they face. God, I love this book. Aside from romance, this book analyzes many more in-depth questions of the 
              universe. Okay, maybe I'm being dramatic, but whatever. Here is an excerpt from the essay I was talking about. Don't judge me. I'm not 
              the best writer, okay. Chill out. All you need to know for context is that the essay is about how I like space.
              <br><br>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br>
              "One of my favorite young adult books containing space travel is Eliot Schrefer’s The Darkness Outside Us which follows the 
              journey of two boys as they venture through space to find a new, habitable planet after theirs is destroyed. The twist is that 
              the boys journeying are a couple of the many clones of themselves hidden on the spaceship. Every hundred years or so, when the 
              ship is in need of repairs, a new pair of clones is awoken, without recollection of any of the past clones’ lives or of even 
              getting on the ship to begin with, and then killed once the repairs are complete. The goal is that this process will continue 
              until the ship reaches its destination and the last pair of clones starts cultivating a new race of humans. This book is a 
              beautiful and tragic rendering of the loneliness of space and the potential of close proximity as a cause for both strong 
              relationships and volatile hostility. 
              <br>
              While The Darkness Outside Us may be a fictional book, it effectively conveys the concept of eternal space through the 
              characters’ loneliness and isolation, and it poses the questions of what happens after Earth can no longer support human life. 
              The technology and advanced ideas in the novel have merit, if such things were possible in real life, which they very well could 
              be in billions of years when the earth is eventually engulfed by the sun. The book touches upon the notion that (1) no human can 
              live long enough to brave space travel and land on a faraway planet and (2) no spacecraft can sustain life for the entire 
              duration of the trip. "

            <h4>By Kate Dylan</h4>
            <p>I thought this book was amazing. If you are (like I was) looking for a distopian fantasy with a badass female lead and an enemies 
              to lovers style romance that doesn't overwhelm the plot, this book is perfect for you. I thought the story was great. I thought the 
              characters were great. I laughed. I cried. Though the book really isn't sad, I'm just an empath. And I'm not joking. I cry at the 
              most not sad books. I cry if someone is being mean to the main character. I cry when the main character feels lost and alone. I cry 
              at literally any minor inconvenience the characters face. You will notice that will be a common theme in all my reviews. Anyways, 
              I thought this book was so fun and awesome. 
              <br><br>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br>
              The ending was less than satisfying in my opinion. It felt like there were just so many plotlines that didn't get their ending, but 
              I guess that's kind of the point? Like things don't just resolve themselves immediately. It also gives the reader the ability to 
              use their imagination to how things played out. As a romantic, I wish Sil and Ryder had an epilogue where they were all happy and 
              kissing, but whatever. I can use my imagination 
              <br><br>
              Another plotline I would've loved to see through is everything with Sil's family. We didn't get to see her reunite with her parents 
              after she was free of her CIP. I'd have liked her to go to them and have a great reunion where she said she was okay and would be 
              living for many years to come. What can I say, I just love happy endings. Not that we didn't get one... But still!
