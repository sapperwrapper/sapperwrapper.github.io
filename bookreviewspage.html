        <p>Welcome to my book reviews page! Now, this won't have all the books I've read because lord knows I read too damn many. I am 
          mainly planning on reviewing my favorites and least favorites. Books that stood out to me. And so, you're going to see a lot of 5 
          star and 1 star reviews. The 3 star books are just okay and I don't feel thinking about them for longer than I have to. Anyways, 
          please enjoy! Feel free to click the Goodreads icon in the title to see all the books I've read on my goodreads account.

            <h3>Wolfsong Series: <img src="5stars.jpg" width="100px"></h3>
            <h4>T.J. Klune</h4>
            <p>God, how I love T.J. Klune. All of his books are amazing and I've read so many of them. The Wolfsong series is one of my favorite 
              book series ever. Ever book was phenomenal, but the first book will always hold a special place in my heart. Joe and Ox will always 
              have a special place in my heart. The first book is the one I re-read the most.
              <br><br>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br>
              So what do I like? Besides everything? Like I've said before, I'm a sucker for main character sympathy and one of the best things 
              I find about this series is that Ox saves the day in the end. He's been through so much and I love how he just gains power and 
              confidence in every book until he's the alpha of everything at the end and defeats the worst enemy of all. There is literally nothing 
              wrong with Ox. I will be an Ox sympathizer until I die. He would do anything for those he loves and the people around him would do 
              anything for him. And I love Joe, of course. He loves Ox more than life itself and Ox deserves nothing less. Oh how I love love.
              <br><br>
              Besides Ox and Joe, I think Robbie and Kelly are my next favorite. They are so cutie and Robbie's story was so interesting to read. 
              Every character goes through hardships, but in the end, it just brings them all closer together. I loved how all the books flow together. 
              Each plot was different and unique and I have absolutely zero complaints. I laughed and cried both so much throughout these books. I remember 
              being hesitant before I read the book for the first time, looking at it on my TBR list with not much interest. Maybe the synopsis didn't appeal 
              to me that much at first, but oh my god was this series amazing. I want a short Ox and Joe epilogue with no more conflict, no more fighting. 
              Just kisses and happily ever afters. T.J. Klune, if you see this, I love you and all of your books.

            <h4>J.K. Rowling</h4>
            <p>Why not just throw the Harry Potter series on here. Even though J.K. Rowling is a homophobic, transphobic piece of shit, read the Harry Potter books. 
              You are never to old to read them. They will always be entertaining.
              <br><br>
              Not much else I want to say. The movies are great. The books are great. Drarry is real. I won't reread the books because Drarry is 
              not canon and it makes me sad. Drarry is the best ship (for Draco and Harry) and I will hear no arguments. Stop pushing your hetero

            <p>I write and read fanfiction for this series. I feel like that's all you need to know. These books are outlandish and amazing 
              and I've never been so obsessed with another series in my 20 years of living. I am waiting for all the books in the Sunshine Court 
              series to come out becasue lord knows I'll be obsessed with that one too and it deserves binging in a blanket cave for days on end.

            <h3>Throne of Glass Series: <img src="5stars.jpg" width="100px"></h3>
            <h4>Sarah J. Maas</h4>
            <p>Ok, let's talk Sarah J. Maas. First of all, love her books. Love ACOTAR, love Crescent City, and love TOG. The big three, if 
              you will. There's just something about a badass female lead that really gets to me, and I love the romance as well, of course. 
              I think I am only going to put my review of the Throne of Glass series because I think it's the best. Now, I would argue that 
              my favorite book from her, the one I re-read the most, is the first Crescent City book (House of whatever and whatever), but I haven't read the next book in the series, and to 
              be honest I probably never will. I've just lost interest. Have moved on to bigger and better things. Just kidding. But yeah I just 
              don't think I'll ever finish the series. Still love her books, still love badass YA fantasy novels. But I think I've moved on from 
              the mainstream ones. You probably won't see a lot of book review on here that would come up in booktok unless I read the book a while 
              ago. I just like to keep my little books to myself.
              <br><br>
              Anyways, let's talk Throne of Glass. Arguably the best book series ever. Or maybe I just read it in a time in my life where I 
              needed it and now the legacy it holds in my head is simply unbeatable. Like I already mentioned, I love myself a badass female 
              lead, and this series has loads of them. Aelin, of course, is my favorite. Listen, I'm a rule follower, what can I say! In most 
              books and movies and TV shows, I will root for the main character. The main character will be my favorite. The author wants me 
              to think a certain way about a character? Guess what. I will. I'm not a complex person. Don't get me wrong, I love all the women 
              (and men) in TOG, but no one gets to me as much as Aelin. I would die for her. There aren't enough words to express my love for 
              these books. I just love how, no matter what she's faced with, Aelin perserveres with a confidence she might not even feel.
              <br><br>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br>
              I love Sarah J. Maas's story building. In all her books, really. I loved all the different plotlines in TOG and loved how they all 
              came together in the end. I think the only thing I would've liked more about the series is if the ending had more of Aelin saving 
              the day in battle, with one final plan that ended it all. I'm a sucker for the happily ever afters, okay! I want my main character 
              to pull through and get their final hurrah before the end. I love that Yrene saved the day, essentially. But I feel like Aelin faced 
              so many hardships, has been through so much trauma, and she should've been the one to end it. But, I do understand that might've been 
              a little much maybe? A little predictable.
              <br><br>
              If you haven't read these books yet, what are you doing? I feel like they're a right of passage into book culture. Screw the classics. 
              Read TOG. You won't regret it.

            <p>This book will always be one of my favorites. I've re-read it about a million times and when the movie came out, I watched 
              it like 5 times in a row. I love how the characters are written. I love the plot. I love everything! Alex? So funny and smart. 
              Henry? Timid and so darn cutie. This is such a feel good book and is worth the read. This is a short review but only because 
              there are not enough words to describe how cute and sweet and loving and awesome this book is. Go read it right now! The book 
              is better than the movie, though I thought the movie was cute too.

            <p> Oh here we go. This one's a doozy. My first bad review on here. So this review is from about a year ago I think? I typed it up 
              on my computer to vent and now I am sharing it with you. I was on a romance kick at this time, for context. (Still am tbh. Who doesn't love 
              a good romance?) Please excuse the lowercase everything and bad grammar. This was very much a rant. And very much dramatic. But 
              I digress.
              <br><br>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br>
              ok so i've been on a romance kick lately. 
              it's hard for me to read a book in general if it doesn't have some sort of romance in it. so i'm no longer repressing myself 
              and have just gone straight to the romance genre. i really do love those fairytale, happily ever after romances. and i like 
              historical romances, but it's sometimes hit or miss. this book, for example, was a miss for 
              me. i don't know why it got pretty good reviews on kindle, though i didn't really read the reviews. with historical romances, 
              in my opinion as a raging liberal, authors walk a fine line. like ok women don't have rights, but how is this love interest 
              going to respond to that. anyways this book, the Lady of Mystery i think it's called, i thought was going to be great. at 
              first, i loved Phoebe. she was amazing. wanted to change the world, fight for women's rights, refused to fall into the 
              restraints society attempted to put on her and was her own independent woman. now Jeffery i hated, naturally. as a man, 
              he obviously didn't believe in Phoebe's ideals. well not obviously, because everyone should believe in equality, but whatever. 
              i was willing to accept his stupidness and ignorance and rudeness and cockiness and all that for a brief moment, because i 
              thought he would change. i figured the author of this book cared about women's rights based on how they wrote Phoebe and would 
              never allow such a man to be a love interest for her. well long story short, i was disappointed. i made it through half way 
              without Jeffery even changing his ignorant ideals in even the slightest. the romance was ok at times, but never will i ever 
              in a million years EVER be ok with even attraction between such a horrible person. and maybe some would argue that he was a 
              gentleman most of the time, but to that i would say i give absolutely zero shits how he acts on the outside if inside he 
              believes women should have less rights than men simply because of their gender. i have decided not to read any more historical 
              romances for the time being because of this book. like what the fuck. and at the end, Phoebe was actually willing to step back 
              from her activist work for a man who didn't believe in the rights of women. AND even at the very end after the supposed 
              "make-up" after the inevitable conflict, Jeffery STILL disagreed with some of the things in Phoebe's paper outlining FUNDAMENTAL 
              HUMAN RIGHTS. fuck this book honestly. i skimmed through the second half. couldn't even bring myself to read the sexy scenes 
              because i was honestly pretty disgusted. so now that i'm done with these historical romances, i guess i'll read some modern 
              romances. sigh. i liked the historical setting. it seemed more romantic, more simple, more happily ever after. well fuck that. 
              i'm too much of a feminist for this shit.

            <h3>The Darkness Outside Us: <img src="5stars.jpg" width="100px"></h3>
            <h4>Eliot Schrefer</h4>
            <p>I read this book probably 4 years ago now, and it remains one of the best books I've ever read. Since it's been so long, this 
              review isn't going to be too in depth, but to anyone who sees this, this book is everything and you should go read it. I literally 
              used this book, this YA gay romance book, in essays when applying to colleges. This book shook me to my core. It is so devastating that 
              I will probably never reread it, seeing as I am such a sensitive soul. Maybe when I'm not a depressed 20 year old. Do not be fooled by my tenderness, 
              this book does have a happy ending and it's amazing.
              <br><br>
              The romance of this book was, in short, heartwrenching. We follow the story of two boys who keep finding and loving each other in spite 
              of the many hardships they face. God, I love this book. Aside from romance, this book analyzes many more in-depth questions of the 
              universe. Okay, maybe I'm being dramatic, but whatever. Here is an excerpt from the essay I was talking about. Don't judge me. I'm not 
              the best writer, okay. Chill out. All you need to know for context is that the essay is about how I like space.
              <br><br>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br>
              "One of my favorite young adult books containing space travel is Eliot Schrefer’s The Darkness Outside Us which follows the 
              journey of two boys as they venture through space to find a new, habitable planet after theirs is destroyed. The twist is that 
              the boys journeying are a couple of the many clones of themselves hidden on the spaceship. Every hundred years or so, when the 
              ship is in need of repairs, a new pair of clones is awoken, without recollection of any of the past clones’ lives or of even 
              getting on the ship to begin with, and then killed once the repairs are complete. The goal is that this process will continue 
              until the ship reaches its destination and the last pair of clones starts cultivating a new race of humans. This book is a 
              beautiful and tragic rendering of the loneliness of space and the potential of close proximity as a cause for both strong 
              relationships and volatile hostility. 
              <br>
              While The Darkness Outside Us may be a fictional book, it effectively conveys the concept of eternal space through the 
              characters’ loneliness and isolation, and it poses the questions of what happens after Earth can no longer support human life. 
              The technology and advanced ideas in the novel have merit, if such things were possible in real life, which they very well could 
              be in billions of years when the earth is eventually engulfed by the sun. The book touches upon the notion that (1) no human can 
              live long enough to brave space travel and land on a faraway planet and (2) no spacecraft can sustain life for the entire 
              duration of the trip. "

            <p>I thought this book was amazing. If you are (like I was) looking for a distopian fantasy with a badass female lead and an enemies 
              to lovers style romance that doesn't overwhelm the plot, this book is perfect for you. I thought the story was great. I thought the 
              characters were great. I laughed. I cried. Though the book really isn't sad, I'm just an empath. And I'm not joking. I cry at the 
              most not sad books. I cry if someone is being mean to the main character. I cry when the main character feels lost and alone. I cry 
              at literally any minor inconvenience the characters face. You will notice that will be a common theme in all my reviews. Anyways, 
              I thought this book was so fun and awesome. 
              <br><br>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br>
              The ending was less than satisfying in my opinion. It felt like there were just so many plotlines that didn't get their ending, but 
              I guess that's kind of the point? Like things don't just resolve themselves immediately. It also gives the reader the ability to 
              use their imagination to how things played out. As a romantic, I wish Sil and Ryder had an epilogue where they were all happy and 
              kissing, but whatever. I can use my imagination 
              <br><br>
              Another plotline I would've loved to see through is everything with Sil's family. We didn't get to see her reunite with her parents 
              after she was free of her CIP. I'd have liked her to go to them and have a great reunion where she said she was okay and would be 
              living for many years to come. What can I say, I just love happy endings. Not that we didn't get one... But still!
