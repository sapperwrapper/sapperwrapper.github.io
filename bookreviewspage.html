            <h4>By Kate Dylan</h4>
            <p>I thought this book was amazing. If you are (like I was) looking for a distopian fantasy with a badass female lead and an enemies 
              to lovers style romance that doesn't overwhelm the plot, this book is perfect for you. I thought the story was great. I thought the 
              characters were great. I laughed. I cried. Though the book really isn't sad, I'm just an empath. And I'm not joking. I cry at the 
              most not sad books. I cry if someone is being mean to the main character. I cry when the main character feels lost and alone. I cry 
              at literally any minor inconvenience the characters face. You will notice that will be a common theme in all my reviews. Anyways, 
              I thought this book was so fun and awesome. 
              <br><br>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br>
              The ending was less than satisfying in my opinion. It felt like there were just so many plotlines that didn't get their ending, but 
              I guess that's kind of the point? Like things don't just resolve themselves immediately. It also gives the reader the ability to 
              use their imagination to how things played out. As a romantic, I wish Sil and Ryder had an epilogue where they were all happy and 
              kissing, but whatever. I can use my imagination 
              <br><br>
              Another plotline I would've loved to see through is everything with Sil's family. We didn't get to see her reunite with her parents 
              after she was free of her CIP. I'd have liked her to go to them and have a great reunion where she said she was okay and would be 
              living for many years to come. What can I say, I just love happy endings. Not that we didn't get one... But still!
