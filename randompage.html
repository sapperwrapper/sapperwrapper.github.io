        <h3>Never My Little Girl</h3>
        <h4>The Transition (from a father's perspective)</h4>
        <p> once upon a time, my daughter was born <br>
          the best day of my life, i thought <br>
          my little girl <br>
          my crying little girl <br>
          i was overjoyed <br>
          i vowed <br>
          anything was hers <br>
          everything was hers <br>
          for her <br>
          anything <br>
          i vowed to raise her right <br>
          she would never be wanting <br>
          she would never be sad <br>
          my little girl <br>
          but the days passed <br>
          and she was sad <br>
          and she was wanting <br>
          and one day, she died <br>
          my little girl came to me <br>
          and she said <br>
          "Dad I am not your little girl" <br>
          and so that day she died <br>
          and so that day i mourned <br>
          and so that day i grieved <br>
          denial was first <br>
          "Of course you're my little girl" <br>
          my vow <br>
          breaking <br>
          my little girl <br>
          always my little girl <br>
          (always?) <br>
          never <br>
          she was never my little girl <br>
          and she didn't die that day <br>
          because she was never born <br>
          my son <br>
          my son trapped <br>
          trapped in the body of someone he was not <br>
          not my little girl <br>
          but my little boy <br>
          too much time wasted <br>
          wasted on my little girl who never was <br>
          i didn't understand <br>
          i couldn't <br>
          why had He taken my little girl from me <br>
          anger <br>
          denial <br>
          anger <br>
          sadness <br>
          tears <br>
          tears for my little girl <br>
          tears for my little boy <br>
          understanding <br>
          anger <br>
          why would He do this to my little boy <br>
          why would He trap him so <br>
          time wasted in denial <br>
          time wasted in anger <br>
          time wasted <br>
          on the road to acceptance <br>
          understanding <br>
          my son <br>
          my son was born and he is here <br>
          he was always here <br>
          and so i was wrong <br>
          it was this day <br>
          the birth of my son <br>
          the happiest day of my life <br>
          my little girl was born crying but my little boy was born smiling <br>
          with pride <br>
          he was no longer sad <br>
          he was no longer wanting <br>
          my vow fulfilled <br>
          i was always proud <br>
          proud of my little girl <br>
          but prouder of my little boy <br>
          my son who has taken on the hardest task <br>
          the most difficult journey <br>
          to show the world who he is inside. <br>
          <br><br>
          **So basically I read a book, had some thought, and decided to write them down at 3am. This was the product. I am not trans, so 
          I have no idea what it's like. This is my take on a father who has a trans son. A father who doesn't understand, but loves 
          his child, no matter what, as every father should. I don't fucking know. Just read it and don't judge me.**

        <h3>7/9/2024</h3>
          <p> So I'm starting this life helper app thingy because I was scrolling on instagram in bed and I saw an ad that said, word for word,
            "need help getting out of bed everyday" or something like that and I felt attacked so here I am $30 later!
            <br><br>
              So on this first day, I am supposed to make a commitment contract. I need to visualize what my life would be like if I didn't 
            procrastinate and how procrastination negatively affects me. Yatta yatta yatta. So I thought I'd write down my thoughts here.
            <br><br>
              Let's see... If I didn't put off my chores, buying food, eating food, going to work, exercising, etc. I would be living a healthier 
            life all around. I'd be more energized, and therefore hopefully not as tired all the time. Hopefully it'll put my sleep 
            schedule back on track, so I can actually get up in the morning, maybe get a workout in, eat a good breakfast, and go to work. 
            Not only do I need to eat healthier, I need to eat more. I often put off buying groceries even when the store is right across 
            the street. No groceries means no food. I know it's contributing to other aspects of my life, but I just can't seem to stop the 
            cycle. Lastly, I need to clean more. Just need to keep my place clean instead of leaving everything to pile up.
            <br><br>
              I know all this is going to come down to cutting my reading time. Whenever I tell people that I read, they're always like "omg 
            so smart" but little do they know that my binge reading is no better than their binge watching. I read on my ipad, so I'm 
            still staring at a screen. I read into all hours of the night, so my sleep is still messed up. The only difference is that 
            when you're watching something, you can multitask, but when you're reading something, you can't. At least not me. I don't even 
            like to walk on the treadmill or anything when I read because I like to be in my little bed blanket cacoon. When I binge read 
            I end up reading a book a day. It depends on the book if I can stop in the middle. Usually for romance books and such, I like 
            to read them all the way through because I feel like I lose the magic if I sleep on it. I CAN'T LOSE THE MAGIC. I just love love. 
            <br><br>
              Anyways, my goals right now are to establish a proper routine for getting what I need done and eat some goddamn healthy food for once.
          </p>
