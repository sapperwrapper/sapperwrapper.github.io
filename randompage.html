        <h3>Never My Little Girl</h3>
        <h4>The Transition (from a father's perspective)</h4>
        <p> once upon a time, my daughter was born <br>
          the best day of my life, i thought <br>
          my little girl <br>
          my crying little girl <br>
          i was overjoyed <br>
          i vowed <br>
          anything was hers <br>
          everything was hers <br>
          for her <br>
          anything <br>
          i vowed to raise her right <br>
          she would never be wanting <br>
          she would never be sad <br>
          my little girl <br>
          but the days passed <br>
          and she was sad <br>
          and she was wanting <br>
          and one day, she died <br>
          my little girl came to me <br>
          and she said <br>
          "Dad I am not your little girl" <br>
          and so that day she died <br>
          and so that day i mourned <br>
          and so that day i grieved <br>
          denial was first <br>
          "Of course you're my little girl" <br>
          my vow <br>
          breaking <br>
          my little girl <br>
          always my little girl <br>
          (always?) <br>
          never <br>
          she was never my little girl <br>
          and she didn't die that day <br>
          because she was never born <br>
          my son <br>
          my son trapped <br>
          trapped in the body of someone he was not <br>
          not my little girl <br>
          but my little boy <br>
          too much time wasted <br>
          wasted on my little girl who never was <br>
          i didn't understand <br>
          i couldn't <br>
          why had He taken my little girl from me <br>
          anger <br>
          denial <br>
          anger <br>
          sadness <br>
          tears <br>
          tears for my little girl <br>
          tears for my little boy <br>
          understanding <br>
          anger <br>
          why would He do this to my little boy <br>
          why would He trap him so <br>
          time wasted in denial <br>
          time wasted in anger <br>
          time wasted <br>
          on the road to acceptance <br>
          understanding <br>
          my son <br>
          my son was born and he is here <br>
          he was always here <br>
          and so i was wrong <br>
          it was this day <br>
          the birth of my son <br>
          the happiest day of my life <br>
          my little girl was born crying but my little boy was born smiling <br>
          with pride <br>
          he was no longer sad <br>
          he was no longer wanting <br>
          my vow fulfilled <br>
          i was always proud <br>
          proud of my little girl <br>
          but prouder of my little boy <br>
          my son who has taken on the hardest task <br>
          the most difficult journey <br>
          to show the world who he is inside. <br>
          <br><br>
          **So basically I read a book, had some thoughts, and decided to write them down at 3am. This was the product. I am not trans, so 
          I have no idea what it's like. This is my take on a father who has a trans son. A father who doesn't understand, but loves 
          his child, no matter what, as every father should. I don't fucking know. Just read it and don't judge me.**

        <h3>7/9/2024</h3>
          <p> So I'm starting this life helper app thingy because I was scrolling on instagram in bed and I saw an ad that said, word for word,
            "need help getting out of bed everyday" or something like that and I felt attacked so here I am $30 later!
            <br><br>
              So on this first day, I am supposed to make a commitment contract. I need to visualize what my life would be like if I didn't 
            procrastinate and how procrastination negatively affects me. Yatta yatta yatta. So I thought I'd write down my thoughts here.
            <br><br>
              Let's see... If I didn't put off my chores, buying food, eating food, going to work, exercising, etc. I would be living a healthier 
            life all around. I'd be more energized, and therefore hopefully not as tired all the time. Hopefully it'll put my sleep 
            schedule back on track, so I can actually get up in the morning, maybe get a workout in, eat a good breakfast, and go to work. 
            Not only do I need to eat healthier, I need to eat more. I often put off buying groceries even when the store is right across 
            the street. No groceries means no food. I know it's contributing to other aspects of my life, but I just can't seem to stop the 
            cycle. Lastly, I need to clean more. Just need to keep my place clean instead of leaving everything to pile up.
            <br><br>
              I know all this is going to come down to cutting my reading time. Whenever I tell people that I read, they're always like "omg 
            so smart" but little do they know that my binge reading is no better than their binge watching. I read on my ipad, so I'm 
            still staring at a screen. I read into all hours of the night, so my sleep is still messed up. The only difference is that 
            when you're watching something, you can multitask, but when you're reading something, you can't. At least not me. I don't even 
            like to walk on the treadmill or anything when I read because I like to be in my little bed blanket cacoon. When I binge read 
            I end up reading a book a day. It depends on the book if I can stop in the middle. Usually for romance books and such, I like 
            to read them all the way through because I feel like I lose the magic if I sleep on it. I CAN'T LOSE THE MAGIC. I just love love. 
            <br><br>
              Anyways, my goals right now are to establish a proper routine for getting what I need done and eat some goddamn healthy food for once.
          </p>

        <h3>Silent? Or silenced?</h3>
        <p>i screm <br>
          i scream and scream <br>
          scream with all my heart <br>
          i scream my guilt and my empathy <br>
          my regret and my sympathy <br>
          my failures <br>
          i scream so loud but my lips are shut <br>
          my heart wails but i remain soundless <br>
          i scream in fear <br>
          fear of the creations of man <br>
          fear of the thoughts of man <br>
          men and others <br>
          men and no others <br>
          men <br>
          my lips are sewn shut as i scream and scream <br>
          sewn by the fingers of the patriarchy <br>
          my head's crowded with thoughts <br>
          my chest's roaring with screams <br>
          but i lay still <br>
          motionless <br>
          soundless <br>
          i sleep and wait <br>
          until the next day <br>
          and the next <br>
          i wait <br>
          i scream <br>
          i am silent <br>
          silenced.

        <h3>Me and Books</h3>
        <p>this week has actually been great. don't have a valentine (sadly? who knows) but we did galentines last night which was fun. 
          had some good food. watched some good movies. i've been less anxious lately i think because i've been having a great time with 
          the roommies. but it's still hard for me to sleep with all the thoughts in my head. what i really need to do is blog then. to get 
          out all my thoughts. but then i feel like i'd just be pushing my sleep schedule back farther. anyways, reading helps. always has.
          <br><br>
          so. me and books. books are my escape. they're my sanity. they're the reason i have high standards in men (and women? who knows). 
          i think books sometimes make me feel more lonely than i already do. but i'll never tell anyone that. maybe it's a natural feeling. 
          to feel lonely when reading. i mean post-book depression hits hard. that i know is a thing. but the loneliness i feel will never 
          stop me from reading. books are my drug. they're addictive. as soon as i finish one, i need another to take my mind off the 
          depression. the loneliness. i suppose it depends on the book, though. those feelings. and how much the book meant to me. i just 
          finished Sorcery of Thorns. it was good. not amazing. not sure if i'll write a review on it or not. probably not. i did say that 
          i wouldn't review every book i read. anyways, that book didn't give me too much depression. not too much loneliness. i think it 
          was too YA for me if that makes sense? i mean the main character is 16. i was so hyper focused on her being so young. it was still 
          a great novel but i think that and the fact that it's a standalone made me not connect to it so much. i haven't decided which book 
          or book series to start next. i'm on a magic kick. like an action/adventure/romance/dystopian kick. if anyone sees this, leave 
          recommendations.
          <br><br>
          so i've read like almost 500 books since i've started to love reading. i'm almost done with what is probably my complete list. 
          obviously i've probably forgotten to add some to the list. but i've stored them on this app that i hope i can link here. that would 
          be cool to share. the books i like range from murder mystery to action to romance and more. i like strong female characters. i am 
          a feminist after all. i don't think i could make it through a book from a man's pov. ew. unless of course it was a gay romance. 
          of that genre i've read plenty. like i said, i'm back in my YA/NA fantasy novel era. trying to stray from my gay romance era because 
          i don't want it to seem like i'm fetishizing it? idk. i feel like fantasy is a safer genre for some reason. makes me feel more 
          stable. who knows what that means. certainly not me. anyways that's what i'm doing now. in between books, i like to read fanfiction 
          about my favorite books, of course. i like fanfiction because i am very particular about when i start new books. i can't, for 
          example, start a new book when i want to fall asleep within and hour. just no. i also can't read anything in the morning. 
          preferably during the day at all, but sometimes it can't be avoided, considering i like reading my books in one sitting. i've 
          gotten better about that recently. i've been able to read for a couple hours each night. but that's with the fantasy novels i 
          think. my gay romances? or any romance for that matter? yeah those are read without stopping. i feel like you lose the connection 
          to the book when you sleep on it you know? my ideal time to start a book of about 300 pages is like 3pm. start at 3, read til 10 
          or 11. perfect. repeat the next day. see that's hard to do when you're in school. over the summer, i was reading a book a day. 
          now, more like 2 books a week. which i still enjoy. that's another reason i switched back to fantasy. again, i could never do 
          that with my juicy, smutty romance. that's just the truth.
          <br><br>
          alright so i'm just dumping all my thoughts about my love of books and reading. i mentioned that i don't like reading during the 
          day. my ideal reading space would be like a dimly lit cave of blankets. my little reading cave. isn't there a saying that more 
          truths are spoken in the dark? i don't know if that's related. i just feel more comfortable reading at night. like it's more 
          intimate somehow. like i can build a deeper connection to the book in the dark. that's probably the same with people. how should 
          i know. anyways, that leads me into my dislike of paper books. there. i said it. i know i know. i'm a horrible person, but whatever. 
          i've spoken my truth. i don't like paper books. i much prefer ebooks. i love reading on my ipad. first of all, reading digitally 
          allows me to read all hours into the night without a reading light. now that's my kinda night. also it's just so convenient having 
          all your books in one spot, available at the touch of a finger. since i read so many books, so fast because i'm a loner with nobody 
          and nothing to do, it's so nice to just buy a book and be able to read it literally 2 seconds later. i can't imagine finishing a 
          book and not being able to immediately start the next book. can't imagine having to wait 2-3 business days to get the next in the 
          series. or having to actually leave my bed to go buy it. gross. i know so many people are gung ho about paper books. loving the 
          smell and feel of them or whatever, but i just don't care. my favorite thing about reading is actually reading. not the touch 
          and feel of a book in my hand. maybe those people think i just don't understand. maybe they think i'm weird or deprived, but 
          whatever. i've tried paper books and i just don't love them. i guess i just can't appreciate them the way some people can. now 
          if i actually wrote a book, i'd want that thing printed a hundred times over, but as it is, i'll stick with my ebooks. another 
          thing is that books are expensive. paper books and ebooks alike, don't get me wrong, but i'll stick to my kindle unlimited books. 
          fucking love kindle unlimited. though it doesn't really have all the popular booktok and bookstagram books. which is usually just 
          fine for me because i hate following the crowds on which books to read, but right now i'm being a big fat hypocrite and reading 
          all the trendy fantasy novels. but yeah. kindle unlimited. amazing.
          <br><br>
          anyways back to the not following the bandwagon. i have nothing against the books everyone likes. but my favorites tend to be the 
          more niche ones. not super super niche ok. but like not 1mil reviews on good reads. i guess it's just because of how reading is 
          my escape you know? how can it be my escape when everyone and their mother is there also? i want to hold my books close to my 
          chest and never let them leave. never let anyone see them. the characters are for me and me only. i know that's not logical but 
          it's how i feel. i'll gatekeep my favorite books til the end of time. i'm not a good book club person because i hate talking 
          about the books i read. again, because i want to feel like those books are mine. like they were written for me. i'm just a 
          sensitive little bitch really. i don't know if i'm making any sense. i like talking about this here. where no one's likely to 
          see. or if they do, they don't know me. i'll gladly talk here about my books. where it's just me and a screen. but elsewhere? 
          no. those are my little treasures. not to be shared with the world. maybe that makes me weird. maybe that makes me greedy. but 
          i don't care.
          <br><br>
          another little aside on the sensitive bit, i'm an extreme empath at times it feels like. i cry for all the main characters in my 
          books. mainly the women of course. ain't gonna cry for no man. but i cry during books that aren't sad, during scenes that aren't 
          sad. but i just cry. i cry for how people treat my main character you know? like she's taking it like a badass, but i'm breaking 
          down. oh another thing is that i'm a main character kinda girl. my favorite character will always be the main character so long 
          as i actually like the book. i can't understand how some people could like side characters better. i will die for my main 
          characters. really i'm just a sensitive little baby. my mind works just like the authors want it to most of the time. fight for 
          the main character and fall for the love interest. that's another think. i can't read a book if there's no romance subplot. well 
          i can. but usually it won't be a favorite. gotta have something. and they have to live happily ever after. of course. i mean i 
          did love divergent and she freaking died at the end, but whatever. i was really depressed after that. naturally.
          <br><br>
          i forget what else i was going to say so this is it for now. if anyone out there actually found this and read it all, you're 
          cool.

        <h3>Late Night Ramblings</h3>
        <p>why am i awake right now? every morning i wake up and dread leaving my bed. i want to stay under the covers for days instead of 
          hours and minutes. every day i'm tired beyond belief. i spend my days yawning and yearning for a nap for sleep for something. and 
          then i get there. i get to nighttime and i can't find it. can't find sleep. i have so many thoughts in my head. too many. i read 
          and sometimes those thoughts fall away and i can read myself to sleep. but some nights are like tonight. where i can't shut my brain 
          off when i shut my book off. i make up stories in my head to fall asleep. doesn't everyone? but sometimes those stories don't help. 
          sometimes they're not as comforting as they usually are. sometimes they morph into random scenarios that aren't the specific ones 
          i've designed in my head and then everything is wrong and then i can't sleep because everything is wrong in my head. i make up so 
          many stories that they all blend together and i can't keep my thoughts straight. my anxiety can't turn off my thoughts of reality 
          any more than it can turn of my thoughts of fantasy. so they both end up swirling there. i stress about my classes and my exams and 
          talking to people and meeting people and the trip i'm taking this summer and money and food. i stress and i stress and right along 
          with those thoughts, i dream. i dream i'm not lonely. i dream i'm not weak and awkward and sensitive. my thoughts contradict 
          themselves. and i lay awake. always awake when i just want to sleep. because i'm tired. so tired. i hope i can find it. sleep 
          that is. and i hope that when i wake up tomorrow i wake with some motivation to live. that sounds pretty dark and depressing, 
          but this week has really not been my week. and it's only tuesday.</p>
